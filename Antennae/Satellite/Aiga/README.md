**Important remarks:**

- The length of the boom is not important provided that it is long enought to support all elements (820mm + what you consider the most confortable for grabbing the antenna).
- The last element of the antenna must be the Director 5 for the UHF band. It must be placed at the most top of the boom
- TheDirector 2 for the VHF band must be placed exactly 10mm under the Director 5 for the UHF band. This is easily done if you print out 3D supports, since their width is just 10mm and this means placing them contiguously.
- Once you have placed these two elements, start measuring the distances between the rest of them in order to build the antenna.
- It is highly recommended painting some marks on the boom corresponding to the exact position of each element. In this way, it is possible to assemble the antenna pretty fast (in under a minute!)
